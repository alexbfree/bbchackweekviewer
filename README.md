# Downloaded Personal Data Viewer UI - Proof of Concept
## by Alex Bowyer, for a BBC R&D Hack event

This is a proof of context UI allowing you to load GDPR data from certain online services such as Netflix, Facebook, Google, and NatWest and view it in a UI.

Further context is available in these [3 videos](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/BBC-Hack-Week-Workflow-Design-Showcase-Alex-Bowyer-Jasmine-Cox--BybXA5HGoeBFWaF43nw_YACZAg-uhscUSznsxJji8ubAm0Su).

Note to interested devs: After this project, I do not recommend using [Mobile Angular UI](http://mobileangularui.com/). It's very awkward and limiting to use.

# Another place to view your downloaded data

For some more advanced tools for viewing your own data, I recommend visiting [digipower.academy](https://digipower.academy) by [hestia.ai](https://www.hestia.ai) and trying their free tools for viewing data from Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Tiktok, Uber, Netflix, and more.
